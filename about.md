I am the lead for the Managed Runtimes and System Libraries team at Rivos, a RISC-V hardware focused company. I contribute to many projects to make sure they are well supported on RISC-V. I'm also the lead for the Language Runtimes working group at [RISE](https://riseproject.dev/) ([learn more on all the projects we are contributing to](https://wiki.riseproject.dev/display/HOME/Language+Runtimes+WG)).

I previously worked at Datadog leading the Java Profiler product, contributing to many APM related projects, and pushing forward the state of serviceability in the OpenJDK project.

I also worked as a software engineer in the Java Engineering Group at Microsoft. I worked on everything related to OpenJDK, and my later focus was porting the OpenJDK on Windows-AArch64 and macOS-AArch64.

I joined Xamarin in March 2014, then Microsoft, in March 2016, through Xamarinâ€™s acquisition. During my time at Xamarin, I worked on the Mono Runtime and its integration to the various Xamarin products (Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, VS for Mac). After a short stint in the .NET team from March 2019 to May 2019, I joined the Java Engineering Group in May 2019.

Over these experiences, I worked on a broad range of runtime related technologies, from GC to compilers (JIT and AOT), to integration to many platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, PS4, Xbox, WebAssembly), architectures (x86, aarch64, riscv64), technologies (LLVM, JVM, profilers), and workloads (data analytics, deep learning, machine learning, graph analytics).

I currently live in Paris, France with my wife and dog. We regularly travel to Brazil and France, our home countries.
