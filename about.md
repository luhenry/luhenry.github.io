I joined Xamarin in March 2014, then Microsoft in March 2016 through Xamarin's acquisition. During my time at Xamarin, I worked on the Mono Runtime and its integration to the various Xamarin products (Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, VS for Mac). After a short stint in the .NET team from March 2019 to May 2019, I joined the Java Platform team in May 2019.

Over this time, I worked on a broad range of runtime related technologies, from GC to JIT, to integration to many platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, PS4, Xbox, WebAssembly) and many technologies (LLVM, JVM, profilers).

I currently live in Seattle with my wife, after doing a cross-country roadtrip (some epic discoveries on the way!). We regularly travel to Brazil and France - our home countries, - and other destinations (recently Columbia, California, New Orleans, Italy, Nova Scotia); we still have many destinations in mind (British Columbia, Texas, Alaska and others).
