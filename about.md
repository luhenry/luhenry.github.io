I am a software engineer in the Java Engineering Group at Microsoft. I work on anything related to OpenJDK, and my later focus has been on the OpenJDK on ARM64 (Linux, Windows, and macOS).

I joined Xamarin in March 2014, then Microsoft, in March 2016, through Xamarinâ€™s acquisition. During my time at Xamarin, I worked on the Mono Runtime and its integration to the various Xamarin products (Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, VS for Mac). After a short stint in the .NET team from March 2019 to May 2019, I joined the Java Engineering Group in May 2019.
Over this time, I worked on a broad range of runtime related technologies, from GC to JIT, to integration to many platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, PS4, Xbox, WebAssembly) and technologies (LLVM, JVM, profilers).

I currently live in Seattle with my wife, after making a cross-country road trip (some epic discoveries on the way!). We regularly travel to Brazil and France, our home countries.
